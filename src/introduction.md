# Crimpdeq

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="assets/logo.png" width="40%"></p>

Meet Crimpdeq, a portable digital force sensor designed for climbers, coaches, and therapists to measure and train finger strength, pulling power, and endurance. It was inspired by [Tindeq Progressor](https://tindeq.com/product/progressor/), and works with the [Tindeq](https://tindeq.com/) and [Frez](https://www.frez.app/) apps.

## Specs

- Rechargeable battery with USB-C charging
- Communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- Open-source firmware written in Rust
- Open-source PCB design
- Automatic sleep when inactive
